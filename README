Haskell Style Guide
===================

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of
conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that
project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the
code in it is in a consistent style.

This project holds the style guidelines I use for my code.  If you are
modifying a project that was created by me, you may be pointed to this
style guide.
