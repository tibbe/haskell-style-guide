Haskell Style Guide
===================

This is a short document describing the preferred coding style for
this project.  I've tried to cover the major areas of formatting and
naming.  When something isn't covered by this guide you should stay
consistent with the code in the other modules.

Formatting
----------

### Line Length

Maximum line length is *80 characters*.

### Indentation

Tabs are illegal. Use spaces for indenting.  Indent your code blocks
with *4 spaces*.  Indent the `where` keyword two spaces to set it
apart from the rest of the code and indent the definitions in a
`where` clause 2 spaces. Some examples:

```haskell
sayHello :: IO ()
sayHello = do
    name <- getLine
    putStrLn $ greeting name
  where
    greeting name = "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"

filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter _ []     = []
filter p (x:xs)
    | p x       = x : filter p xs
    | otherwise = filter p xs
```

### Blank Lines

One blank line between top-level definitions.  No blank lines between
type signatures and function definitions.  Add one blank line between
functions in a type class instance declaration if the functions bodies
are large.  Use your judgement.

### Whitespace

Surround binary operators with a single space on either side.  Use
your better judgement for the insertion of spaces around arithmetic
operators but always be consistent about whitespace on either side of
a binary operator.  Don't insert a space after a lambda.

### Data Declarations

Align the constructors in a data type definition.  Example:

```haskell
data Tree a = Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
            | Leaf
```

For long type names the following formatting is also acceptable:

```haskell
data HttpException
    = InvalidStatusCode Int
    | MissingContentHeader
```

Format records as follows:

```haskell
data Person = Person
    { firstName :: String  -- ^ First name
    , lastName  :: String  -- ^ Last name
    , age       :: Int     -- ^ Age
    } deriving (Eq, Show)
```

### List Declarations

Align the elements in the list.  Example:

```haskell
exceptions =
    [ InvalidStatusCode
    , MissingContentHeader
    , InternalServerError
    ]
```

Optionally, you can skip the first newline.  Use your judgement.

```haskell
directions = [ North
             , East
             , South
             , West
             ]
```

### Pragmas

Put pragmas immediately following the function they apply to.
Example:

```haskell
id :: a -> a
id x = x
{-# INLINE id #-}
```

In the case of data type definitions you must put the pragma before
the type it applies to.  Example:

```haskell
data Array e = Array
    {-# UNPACK #-} !Int
    !ByteArray
```

### Hanging Lambdas

You may or may not indent the code following a "hanging" lambda.  Use
your judgement. Some examples:

```haskell
bar :: IO ()
bar = forM_ [1, 2, 3] $ \n -> do
          putStrLn "Here comes a number!"
          print n

foo :: IO ()
foo = alloca 10 $ \a ->
      alloca 20 $ \b ->
      cFunction a b
```

### Export Lists

Format export lists as follows:

```haskell
module Data.Set
    (
      -- * The @Set@ type
      Set
    , empty
    , singleton

      -- * Querying
    , member
    ) where
```

Imports
-------

Imports should be grouped in the following order:

1. standard library imports
2. related third party imports
3. local application/library specific imports

Put a blank line between each group of imports.  The imports in each
group should be sorted alphabetically, by module name.

Always use explicit import lists or `qualified` imports for standard
and third party libraries.  This makes the code more robust against
changes in these libraries.  Exception: The Prelude.

Comments
--------

### Punctuation

Write proper sentences; start with a capital letter and use proper
punctuation.

### Top-Level Definitions

Comment every top level function (particularly exported functions),
and provide a type signature; use Haddock syntax in the comments.
Comment every exported data type.  Some examples:

```haskell
-- | Send a message on a socket.  The socket must be in a connected
-- state.  Returns the number of bytes sent.  Applications are
-- responsible for ensuring that all data has been sent.
send :: Socket      -- ^ Connected socket
     -> ByteString  -- ^ Data to send
     -> IO Int      -- ^ Bytes sent

-- | Bla bla bla.
data Person = Person
    { age  :: Int     -- ^ Age
    , name :: String  -- ^ First name
    }
```

For functions the documentation should give enough information to
apply the function without looking at the function's definition.

### End-of-Line Comments

Separate end-of-line comments from the code using 2 spaces.  Align
comments for data type definitions.  Some examples:

```haskell
data Parser = Parser
    Int         -- Current position
    ByteString  -- Remaining input

foo :: Int -> Int
foo n = salt * 32 + 9
  where
    salt = 453645243  -- Magic hash salt.
```

### Links

Use in-line links economically.  You are encouraged to add links for
API names.  It is not necessary to add links for all API names in a
Haddock comment.  We therefore recommend adding a link to an API name
if:

* The user might actually want to click on it for more information (in
  your judgment), and

* Only for the first occurrence of each API name in the comment (don't
  bother repeating a link)

Naming
------

Use mixed-case when naming functions and camel-case when naming data
types.

For readability reasons, don't capitalize all letters when using an
abbreviation.  For example, write `HttpServer` instead of
`HTTPServer`.  Exception: Two letter abbreviations, e.g. `IO`.

### Modules

Use singular when naming modules e.g. use `Data.Map` and
`Data.ByteString.Internal` instead of `Data.Maps` and
`Data.ByteString.Internals`.

Misc
----

### Warnings ###

Code should be compilable with `-Wall -Werror`. There should be no
warnings.
